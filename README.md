# React + Vite + Styled Components
 This is a fun react project where i have made a dice game where the person first have to choose the number of its choice and then roll the dice if the number comes out to be that of chosen one then the score should be that number that was chosen by the player and if not then -2 will be added to the total score.
 To see all the rules player can first read out the rules then start playing.
